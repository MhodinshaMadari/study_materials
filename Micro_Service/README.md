# 🧭 Microservices Learning Roadmap with Java & Spring Boot

This roadmap is designed for experienced Java developers (6+ years) looking to transition from monolithic architecture to microservices using **Spring Boot** and modern DevOps practices.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Foundations of Microservices

### 🔧 Core Concepts
- Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture
- Benefits & Challenges
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Bounded Context
- CAP Theorem & Eventual Consistency

### 💡 Spring Boot & REST Refresher
- Spring Boot Starters & Configuration
- REST APIs with Spring MVC
- DTOs, Validation, Exception Handling

### 🧪 Hands-On
- Create basic microservices (e.g., `UserService`, `OrderService`)
- Inter-service communication using `RestTemplate` or `WebClient`

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Service Communication & Discovery

### 🛰️ Service Discovery
- **Eureka Server** (Spring Cloud Netflix)
- **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**

### 🔄 Inter-Service Communication
- Synchronous: Feign Client
- Asynchronous: RabbitMQ / Apache Kafka

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: API Gateway & Security

### 🌐 API Gateway
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- Routing, Filters, Rate Limiting

### 🛡️ Central Authentication
- JWT Authentication with Spring Security
- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (Keycloak, Auth0)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

## 🧱 Phase 4: Resilience & Observability

### 🔄 Resilience
- Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j / Spring Cloud)
- Retry, Timeout, Fallback
- Rate Limiting

### 👀 Observability
- Centralized Logging: ELK Stack / Loki
- Distributed Tracing: Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin
- Metrics: Micrometer + Prometheus + Grafana

---

## 🗃️ Phase 5: Data Management & Transactions

### 🛢️ Database per Service
- Polyglot Persistence
- Data Sync Strategies (API, Events)

### ⚙️ Distributed Transactions
- Eventual Consistency
- Saga Pattern (Choreography & Orchestration)

---

## 🚢 Phase 6: CI/CD, Docker & Kubernetes

### 🐳 Docker & Local Dev
- Dockerize Each Service
- Docker Compose for Dev Environment

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines
- GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI
- Automated Build, Test & Deploy

### ☸️ Kubernetes
- Pods, Services, Deployments
- Run Spring Boot on K8s
- Optional: Helm Charts

---

## 🧪 Phase 7: Testing Strategies

- Unit Testing: JUnit + Mockito
- Integration Testing
- Testcontainers for DB & Messaging
- Contract Testing: Spring Cloud Contract / Pact

---

## 🎯 Final Project Idea

Build a **Production-Grade System** (e.g., eCommerce, Learning Platform) with:
- Microservices: User, Product, Order, Payment, Notification
- Kafka for Event-Driven Communication
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB per service
- API Gateway + Eureka
- JWT-based Security
- Dockerized & deployed to Kubernetes
