Here‚Äôs a comparison of **Spring Boot** and **Spring MVC**, highlighting their **pros and cons** to help you understand when and why to use each:

---

### üå± **Spring MVC**
Spring MVC is a part of the larger Spring Framework and is used to build web applications following the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
- **Fine-grained control**: Offers detailed configuration options, ideal for complex enterprise applications.
- **Modular**: You can pick and choose which Spring modules to use.
- **Mature and stable**: Well-established with a large community and extensive documentation.
- **Flexible view resolution**: Supports JSP, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, etc.

#### ‚ùå Cons:
- **Verbose configuration**: Requires a lot of XML or Java-based configuration.
- **Steeper learning curve**: More complex setup and boilerplate code.
- **Slower development**: More time-consuming to get a project up and running.

---

### üöÄ **Spring Boot**
Spring Boot is built on top of Spring Framework (including Spring MVC) and aims to simplify the development process by reducing boilerplate code and configuration.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
- **Auto-configuration**: Automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you add.
- **Embedded servers**: Comes with Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, so no need to deploy WAR files.
- **Production-ready**: Includes metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- **Rapid development**: Great for microservices and REST APIs with minimal setup.
- **Opinionated defaults**: Helps you follow best practices without needing to configure everything manually.

#### ‚ùå Cons:
- **Less control**: Auto-configuration can sometimes be too opinionated or hard to override.
- **Larger footprint**: May include unnecessary dependencies if not carefully managed.
- **Learning curve for internals**: Developers may not understand what‚Äôs happening under the hood.

| Quick REST API or microservice | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Learning core Spring concepts | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Production-ready app with minimal setup | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
