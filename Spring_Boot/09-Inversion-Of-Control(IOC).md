### 🧠 What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a fundamental principle in software engineering where the control of object creation and dependency management is **transferred from the application code to a framework or container**. In the context of Spring, IoC means that the **Spring container** is responsible for managing the lifecycle and dependencies of objects (beans).

### 🔄 Traditional vs IoC Approach

#### 🔧 Traditional Approach (Without IoC)
```java
GreetingService service = new GreetingService();
GreetingController controller = new GreetingController(service);
```
- You manually create and wire objects.
- You control the flow and dependencies.

#### 🌱 IoC Approach (With Spring)
```java
@RestController
public class GreetingController {

    private final GreetingService greetingService;

    @Autowired
    public GreetingController(GreetingService greetingService) {
        this.greetingService = greetingService;
    }
}
```
- Spring creates and injects `GreetingService` into `GreetingController`.
- You **declare** dependencies, and Spring **provides** them.

### 🧰 How Spring Implements IoC

Spring uses the **IoC Container**, which is essentially the **ApplicationContext**. It:
- Scans classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`
- Creates beans and manages their lifecycle
- Injects dependencies using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or constructor parameters

### 📦 Benefits of IoC

| Benefit               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Loose Coupling**    | Classes depend on interfaces, not implementations |
| **Testability**       | Easier to mock and inject dependencies |
| **Maintainability**   | Centralized configuration and lifecycle management |
| **Flexibility**       | Swap implementations without changing business logic |

### 🧪 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a restaurant:
- **Traditional way**: You go to the kitchen, cook your meal, and serve yourself.
- **IoC way**: You place an order, and the restaurant (Spring) takes care of cooking and serving.

### 🔍 Diagram Breakdown

#### 🟥 Traditional Approach (Left Side)
- **Application Code** manually creates and manages dependencies.
- Full control over object lifecycle remains with the application.

#### 🟦 IoC with Spring (Right Side)
- **Application Code** only declares what it needs.
- **Spring Container**:
  - Creates and injects dependencies.
  - Manages the lifecycle of beans.

This visual highlights how **control is inverted**—from the application managing everything to the **Spring framework taking over** dependency management and lifecycle control.
